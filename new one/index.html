					<u>Edu-popped</u> is a revolutionary product by our company, developed to help the students ease the burden of studies and score more marks.Webcoder-h is an innovative educational content for the students of all State Boardâ€™s 1st to 12th standards for all subjects,as per the syllabus.<br> With the difficulties in education arising now-a-days due to covid-19 epidemic, we have created content which will help the students learn in a better and a new way. It is said what we see (visuals) is often remembered more than what we simply just read. Keeping that concept in mind, we have converted the black and white textbook into audio-video animated content explaining each chapter and subject in detail.<br>
